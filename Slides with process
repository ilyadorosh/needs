## System Architecture - PPT Version

---

## Slide 1: Title
**DEHN Production Equipment Assistant**
*Mathematical Framework for Smart Component Selection*

- **Challenge:** Automate production equipment selection
- **Approach:** Structured reasoning + Engineering rules
- **Goal:** From problem description to compatible components

---

## Slide 2: System Overview
**From Query to Solution in 7 Steps**

```
Problem Query ‚Üí Semantic Analysis ‚Üí Process Mapping ‚Üí Component Search ‚Üí Rule Engine ‚Üí Compatibility Check ‚Üí Final Solution
```

**Key Principle:** Deterministic engineering logic, not AI guesswork

---

## Slide 3: Step 1 - Problem Input
**Natural Language Query Processing**

**Input Example:**
*"We need automated labeling system for FRED production. System should inspect quality, position components, and apply printed labels."*

**Extracted Requirements:**
- Vision inspection ‚úì
- Material handling ‚úì  
- Label printing ‚úì
- Positioning ‚úì

---

## Slide 4: Step 2 - Process Identification
**Semantic Search ‚Üí Process Database**

| Process Type | Process ID | Description |
|--------------|------------|-------------|
| Hauptprozess | 100000 | Apply Label |
| Teilprozess | 100001 | Print and Deploy Label |
| Teilprozess | 100003 | Pick Up, Manipulate Label |
| Teilprozess | 100004 | Position Correction |

**Result:** Collection of relevant processes for the query

---

## Slide 5: Step 3 - Component Mapping  
**Process ‚Üí Building Blocks**

| Process | Required Components |
|---------|-------------------|
| Label Printing (100001) | REA JET Printer, PLC Control |
| Component Handling (100003) | Robot Arm, Pneumatic Gripper |
| Position Correction (100004) | Vision Camera, Processing Unit |

**Database Query:** Get all building blocks for identified processes

---

## Slide 6: Step 4 - Rule Engine (Core Innovation)
**Mathematical Constraint Satisfaction**

**Compatibility Check:**
```
Œ∫(componentA, componentB) = w‚ÇÅ¬∑interface + w‚ÇÇ¬∑physical + w‚ÇÉ¬∑safety
```

**Engineering Rules:**
- ‚úÖ Power compatibility (24V ‚Üî 24V)
- ‚úÖ Interface matching (Ethernet ‚Üî Ethernet)  
- ‚úÖ Physical constraints (mounting, space)
- ‚úÖ Safety compliance (certifications)

**Filter:** Remove incompatible combinations

---

## Slide 7: Step 5 - Optimization
**Multi-Objective Selection**

**Minimize:** 
```
F(solution) = w‚ÇÅ¬∑Cost + w‚ÇÇ¬∑Complexity - w‚ÇÉ¬∑Reliability - w‚ÇÑ¬∑Reuse
```

**Subject to:**
- Complete capability coverage ‚â• 100%
- All compatibility constraints satisfied
- Budget ‚â§ limit
- Component count ‚â§ maximum

---

## Slide 8: Final Output
**Validated Compatible Components**

| Component ID | Component Name | Process | Justification |
|--------------|----------------|---------|---------------|
| 200027 | REA JET Printer | 100001 | Label printing capability |
| 200001 | Industrial Robot | 100003 | Material handling + positioning |
| 200025 | Vision Camera | 100004 | Quality inspection + positioning |
| 200068 | PLC Control Unit | All | Process coordination |

**Solution Metrics:**
- Coverage: 100% ‚úì
- Compatibility: High ‚úì  
- Reliability: 4.2/5 ‚úì
- Total Cost: Within budget ‚úì
